This assignment, I finished out the design document with the special offers, blog, and contact pages. This was more work in refining how I used media queries and responsive design for elements, especially with percentages. This one got particularly confusing with so many overlapping layers of divs that I created trying to create responsive elements. It was a challenge, especially on the special offers page to keep all of the elements in the correct position as the page is made smaller.
